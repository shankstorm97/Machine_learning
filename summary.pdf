# Summary Report

## Introduction

This project involves applying Fisher's Linear Discriminant (FLD) and Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers to a binary classification task using the [Your Dataset Name].

## Dataset

The dataset contains [number of features] numeric features and [number of examples] labeled examples.

- **Total examples**: [number of examples]
- **Classes**: Binary (0: [class name], 1: [class name])

## Data Preparation

The data was split into training and testing sets:

- **Training set**: 75% ([number of training examples])
- **Testing set**: 25% ([number of testing examples])

Normalization was applied using `StandardScaler`.

## Classifier Training

Two classifiers were trained:

1. **Fisher's Linear Discriminant (FLD)**
2. **Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

## Computational Times

| Classifier | Training Time (seconds) | Testing Time (seconds) |
|------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| FLD        | [time]                  | [time]                 |
| SVM        | [time]                  | [time]                 |
